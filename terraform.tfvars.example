# Logging Configuration
# Filter for Cloud Logging sink - empty string means all logs
# Examples:
#   log_filter = ""  # All logs
#   log_filter = "resource.type=\"k8s_container\""  # Only Kubernetes logs

# Cleanup Configuration
# Age threshold in minutes for cleanup function to consider files stale

# Log File Organization
# Prefix path for log files in GCS and S3 (e.g., 'logs' or 'audit-logs')
# Files will be organized as: {log_prefix}/YYYY/MM/DD/hh/RFC3339_<hash>.jsonl
log_prefix = "logs"

# TODO: should we allow the use of existing s3 buckets? (and in that case, also add a prefix within that bucket to dump data?)
