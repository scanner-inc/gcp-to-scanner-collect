#   log_filter = "resource.type=\"k8s_container\""  # Only Kubernetes logs

# Scanner Integration (Optional)
# If you want to integrate with a scanner service, specify BOTH variables below.
# When both are provided:
#   1. The S3 bucket will send notifications to the SNS topic on s3:ObjectCreated:* events
#   2. The scanner role will be granted read permissions to the S3 bucket
#
# Note: Both variables must be specified together, or neither should be specified.
# Specifying only one will cause a validation error.
#
# scanner_sns_topic_arn = "arn:aws:sns:${var.aws_region}:${var.aws_account_id}:scnr-LogsBucketEventNotificationTopic"
# scanner_role_arn      = "arn:aws:iam::${var.aws_account_id}:role/scnr-ScannerRole"

# TODO: should we allow the use of existing s3 buckets? (and in that case, also add a prefix within that bucket to dump data?)
