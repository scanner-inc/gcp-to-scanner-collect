# aws_profile  = "my-profile"  # Optional: specify AWS CLI profile to use (defaults to default profile)

# Logging Configuration
# Filter for Cloud Logging sink - empty string means all logs
# Examples:
#   log_filter = ""  # All logs
#   log_filter = "resource.type=\"k8s_container\""  # Only Kubernetes logs
#   log_filter = "severity>=ERROR"  # Only errors and above
#   log_filter = "logName:\"cloudaudit.googleapis.com\""  # Only audit logs
#   log_filter = "protoPayload.serviceName=\"compute.googleapis.com\""  # Only Compute Engine audit logs

# Cleanup Configuration
# Age threshold in minutes for cleanup function to consider files stale
age_threshold_minutes = 30

# Log File Organization
# Prefix path for log files in GCS and S3 (e.g., 'logs' or 'audit-logs')
# Files will be organized as: {log_prefix}/YYYY/MM/DD/hh/mm_ssZ_<hash>.jsonl
log_prefix = "logs"

# Scanner Integration (Optional)
# If you want to integrate with a scanner service, specify BOTH variables below.
# When both are provided:
#   1. The S3 bucket will send notifications to the SNS topic on s3:ObjectCreated:* events
#   2. The scanner role will be granted read permissions to the S3 bucket
#
# Note: Both variables must be specified together, or neither should be specified.
# Specifying only one will cause a validation error.
#
# Replace the following with your actual configuration (especially region + account number must be changed)
# scanner_sns_topic_arn = "arn:aws:sns:us-east-1:123456789012:scnr-LogsBucketEventNotificationTopic"
# scanner_role_arn      = "arn:aws:iam::123456789012:role/scnr-ScannerRole"
